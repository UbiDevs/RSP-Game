@dataclass
class IsStart:
    """
    A simple class to manage a boolean state, `isStart`, which can be toggled.

    Core Functionality:
    - Toggle the `isStart` state between True and False.

    Usage:
    - Instantiate the class to create an object with an initial `isStart` state of False.
    - Use the `changeIsStart` method to toggle the `isStart` state.

    Example:

    Constructor:
    - No parameters are required to instantiate the class.

    Limitations and Side Effects:
    - The `isStart` attribute is a simple boolean flag and does not have any side effects.
    - The `changeIsStart` method is thread-safe and can be called concurrently without issues.
